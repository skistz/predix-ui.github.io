    <h2 class="selected">Data Visualization</h2>
    <p>Our Data Visualization tools provide vital information to our customers to ensure optimum performance of their Industrial
      ecosystem. Some key areas where our Vis tools can be used are monitoring the health of assets for maintenance optimization,
      a success or failure of factory processes, or the operational status of a group of plants. Creating readable visualizations
      play a vital role in helping our customers make split second decisions on how to proceed with handling a variety of
      situations that in turn could save lives and reduce maintenance costs.</p>

    <p>There are some basic questions one should ask before deciding what chart type would best address the needs of a specific
      situation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the nature of the data?</li>

      <li>What is the expectation of the user on how the data will be presented?</li>

      <li>How many points of data will need to be rendered onto the chart?</li>

      <li>What are the interactions the user will need to evoke when consuming the data?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From there, you can start to have a better understanding of what chart from the vis framework will work best for your
      needs.</p>
