    <h4>Best Practices</h4>
    <b>Exclusively use GE Inspira Sans</b><br>
    <p>
      Inspira Sans and a core part of the GE and Predix brand and was developed with digital use cases in mind. Offered in several
      weights and styles, it is the sole typeface of a Predix app.</p>

    <b>Create a typographic hierarchy</b>
    <p>The Predix Design System has recommended sizes for page elements designed to make it easy to create an easy to scan information
      hierarchy. Utilize these sizes. Consider how your layout will be consumed and build a typographic hierarchy around
      it. Page headers should anchor the page, section.</p>

    <b>Be selective with the use of bold</b>
    <p>The Predix visual language is designed to be lightweight and easy to scan. Overusing bold can make an interface heavy
      and difficult to identify important information. Use Inspira Sans Bold in limited situations such as calling out the
      user's current location in a hierarchy or highlighting their selected state.</p>


    <b>Be consistent</b>
    <p>Consistency is a principle of the design system and it applies to type. Your application should have a consistent and
      expected usage of typography across all workflows.</p>
