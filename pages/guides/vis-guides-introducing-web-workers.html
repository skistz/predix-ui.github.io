        <h2 class="selected">Introducing web workers</h2>

        <p>Increasingly, the px-vis framework has to do more heavy processing as we add new features and support charts with hundreds of thousands of datapoints. User interactions in particular, such as a user hovering over a chart and displaying the closest datapoints in the register, must be highly performant and feel instantaneous. In order to support this and many other processing intensive features, we’ve introduced web workers into px-vis.</p>

        <h4 class="u-pt u-mb++">Background</h4>
        <p>With the introduction of the new crosshair feature, which allows users to hover over a chart to target a datapoint and see that same datapoint highlighted on other charts throughout the page, we looked back at our approach to finding datapoints closest to the user’s mouse. Previously, we were using the rather naïve approach of iterating through every datapoint and measuring the distance to the mouse. Although fine with typical, non-industrial datasets, the size of the datasets used on px-vis charts makes this approach a poor choice. Searching through every point is an O(n) operation each time the user moves their mouse which caused noticeable lag on large datasets and/or on IE 11. To optimize this search time algorithm, we decided to preprocess our data and store it in a quadtree data structure.</p>

        <p>A quadtree stores our data spatially in a tree hierarchy, allowing for testing only a small subset of data when searching for the closest point. You can read more about quadtrees on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree" target="_top">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

          <h5>Visual representation of the quadtrees we use</h5>
        </div>

        <p>I won't expand much more on the actual quadtree search since this isn't the point of this article, but if you are interested here is <a href="https://medium.com/@agafonkin/a-dive-into-spatial-search-algorithms-ebd0c5e39d2a" target="_top">another article</a> that is worth reading and talks about similar spatial tree structures.
        </p>

        <p>Long story short, the quadtree search helps us find those points a lot faster, but we have to pay a price to build and rebuild it: anywhere between 1ms and 2000ms depending on your dataset, browser (who said IE?) and CPU.</p>

        <p>Building the quadtree is slow, however it is not crucial to initializing the chart; we only need it when the user interacts with the chart and not when we are building it. Given this, we certainly don't want it to block the main thread from working on other charts or anything else on the page. That's where web workers come in.</p>


        <h4 class="u-pt u-mb++">What are web workers</h4>
        <p>Javascript is single threaded by nature, meaning that the code will always run on one thread which we'll call the main thread. On top  of that your code execution is also shared with the browser renderer, meaning that if you run too much javascript then the browser doesn't  have enough time to spend on layout and painting. Web workers allow us to shift processing from the main thread to background threads, allowing us to build our quadtress without blocking the building of the chart and webpage, and/or rendering. That helps us limit the performance impact of building our quadtrees while still benefiting from their fast spatial search.</p>

        <p>One of the drawbacks of web workers is the communication overhead. By default, the web workers use a structure cloning algorithm to transfer data (JavaScript objects and arrays) between the main thread and the worker thread. This can be sluggish (in the order of hundreds of ms) when transferring large amounts of data (>20MB). This price has to be paid on the main thread, which is not ideal. Web workers can also accept "transferrable" objects which are a kind of 0 copy transfer, while clearing the original data. Unfortunately, this only applies to binary data: arrayBuffer, bitmap, etc...</p>

        <h4 class="u-pt u-mb++">How are we using them</h4>
        <p>To avoid paying the price of transferring the data every time we need to do something with it in the web worker, such as rebuilding the quadtree after a zoom, we decided to introduce some synchronization. Every time a chart is created it is assigned a specific web worker which it will use for all its background operations. Every time the chart's data changes it will send a copy to its web worker to keep it in sync, effectively  doubling the memory footprint of the data (one set on the chart, one set in the webworker). The quadtree itself is also about 3 times the size of the data, so in a chart that uses the quadtree search the memory used for holding the data will be 5 times the size of its source. Please note that it is a worst case scenario since when building the quadtree we will optimize the keys used in the data to save space and our tests were run with data having small keys already.
        </p>

        <p>This impact only effects the memory used by the data, which should be a smaller subset than the chart itself (which includes DOM nodes, config options, SVGs...). To give an idea of how this impact plays out: our test data stands at 10MB for 400,000 datapoints, and the resulting chart uses 50MB to store the quadtree, source data and synchronized data. The web worker will automatically clean up the source data and quadtree data 1.5s after the chart is detached from the DOM.</p>

        <p>At the moment, the only charts building quadtrees are px-vis-xy-chart and px-vis-polar. Px-vis-timeseries also duplicates the data for searching for its extents in the web worker, but doesn't use the quadtree search (it is already using a binary search relying on the time data being already sorted). Prior to implementing a quadtree with web workers, finding the closest point for a modest 40k dataset took ~50ms per search. Since the search ran on every mouse move, this had a huge negative impact on performance. With our quadtree, each search takes <0.5ms, even on a 4 millions point dataset.</p>

          <h5>4 millions points dataset with old search.</h5>
        </div>

          <h5>4 millions points dataset with quadtree search. Snappy.</h5>
        </div>

        <h4 class="u-pt u-mb++">Configuration</h4>
        <p>To do its job, the web worker must be able to load its code and the d3.js library. When you configure your production app build, you MUST include the px-vis-worker-scale.js and px-vis-worker.js files from px-vis as well as d3.min.js file from the pxd3 folder (which is a dependency of px-d3-imports, itself a dependency of px-vis).</p>

        <p>By default, the web worker scheduler will search for px-vis-worker-scale.js and px-vis-worker.js in the same folder as the px-vis code. The px-vis-worker.js path can be customized through the global window variable <code class="code code--inline">Px.vis.workerUrl</code>, which expects the full path including the file name. The other file will be searched in the same folder.</p>

        <p>The web workers will search for d3 relative to the px-vis-worker.js script : '../pxd3/d3.min.js'. This can be changed through <code class="code code--inline">Px.vis.workerD3Url</code>, again, using the full path including the file name. Note that this URL will still be relative to the web worker script.</p>

        <p>The px-vis scheduler will create as many web workers as cores are available from navigator.hardwareConcurrency, which includes physical and virtual cores, or 4 if this information can't be found. This can be overridden through <code class="code code--inline">Px.vis.maxWorkerCount</code>.</p>

        <p>Since it can be hard to change the configuration variable before the Px web worker code is run you can listen for the <code class="code code--inline">px-vis-worker-init</code> event which will be fired before Px vis setup the web workers.</p>

        <p>It is possible to disable the use of webworkers for charts supporting them by setting <code class="code code--inline">preventWebWorkerSynchronization</code> on a specific chart. In this case the chart will fall back to the previous implementation of spatial search for tooltip data as well as calculating chart extents. However the chart won't be able to use the crosshair mode!</p>

        <h4 class="u-pt u-mb++">Going forward</h4>

        <p>The web workers currently bring us faster spatial search as well as offloading of parsing for dynamic chart extents. The runtime gain of performance as well as just offloading the main thread when searching for extents are in our opinion outweighing the memory footprint increase which should be marginal in most cases.</p>

        <p>We still tried to give the option of disabling webworker for a chart through <code class="code code--inline">preventWebWorkerSynchronization</code>, with the caveat of not being able to use the new crosshair feature. This might be useful in some specific scenarios such as a lot of small chart with minimal interactions.</p>

        <p>But maybe more importantly even though the cloned data is used for only a couple of features right now, it opens the door for us to build more features on the web worker with the data always available.</p>
