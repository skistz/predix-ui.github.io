      <h2 class="selected">What is Predix UI?</h2>
      <p>Predix UI makes it easy to create powerful, user-friendly web applications with components that just work. The system is made up of three parts:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="u-mv--">plug-and-play <strong>components</strong> that speed UI/UX development</li>
        <li class="u-mv--">composable and reusable <strong>CSS modules</strong> that establish consistent design</li>
        <li class="u-mv--">a quick-start <strong>project seed</strong> with everything you need to start building now</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Used together, these tools help teams jumpstart the creation of Industrial Internet web applications running on top of Predix services and data.</p>

      <h4 class="u-mt++ u-pt++">Predix UI Components: UI pieces you need. Already built.</h4>
      <hr class="u--mt--">

      <p>Predix UI Components are a set of user interface pieces that can be quickly snapped together to build an application. Components give you the basic building blocks of a web app, freeing up your time to spend on more important development tasks.</p>

      <p>The components are framework agnostic — they can fit into many existing JavaScript web applications (e.g. Angular, React, Ember), or serve as a starting point for a new project.</p>

      <p>Use the components to do everything from creating a UI foundation for your application to shipping interactive charts that feed off streaming data.</p>

      <h4 class="u-mt++ u-pt++">Predix UI CSS: Consistent, modular design from the start.</h4>
      <hr class="u--mt--">

      <p>Predix UI CSS is a collection of CSS modules that offer consistent design, useful defaults, and customizable styles for web applications. CSS modules can be mixed together to create a strong base for web applications of any size.</p>

      <p>Predix UI CSS modules are written in Sass using the powerful BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) and OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS) code patterns, ensuring your CSS codebase can grow quickly and still be easy to maintain.</p>

      <p>Use CSS modules to create the base typography, layout, and content design for your project, or use them to design new custom components unique to your application. Building with Predix UI CSS ensures consistent design across your entire application.</p>

      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.predix-ui.com/#/guides/use-css/">Use the Predix UI CSS Starter Kit to create a consistent design base for your app.</a></p>

      <h4 class="u-mt++ u-pt++">Predix UI Seed: App starter Kit that's ready for production.</h4>
      <hr class="u--mt--">

      <p>Predix UI Seed is a web application starter kit that can be copied, extended and deployed to production immediately. Everything you need is included:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="u-mv--">A project structure to help teams write organized code using Polymer as an application framework</li>
        <li class="u-mv--">Example Predix UI Components and CSS modules composed to create a dashboard UI</li>
        <li class="u-mv--">Developer tools that speed up the type, save, and reload workflow</li>
        <li class="u-mv--">A Node/Express web server ready to connect to Predix services and APIs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Use the Predix UI Seed to jumpstart your next web application project and create a stable base that your team can extend and build on into the future.</p>

      <p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/predixdev/predix-seed">Open the Predix UI Seed on Github to see how its built, or to use it right now</a></p>

      <h4 class="u-mt++ u-pt++">Build from scratch or use in an existing app. It's your choice.</h4>
      <hr class="u--mt--">

      <p>We know every team has a different workflow. We know each designer and developer likes different tools. That's why we built Predix UI to just work in your workflow and with your tools.</p>

      <p>Developers have used Predix UI to save thousands of hours developing the UI base in huge Angular codebases. Some are using components inside React applications. Others have used the Predix UI Seed to build simple applications using just Polymer and vanilla JavaScript.</p>
