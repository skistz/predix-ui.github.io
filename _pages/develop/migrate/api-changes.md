## General changes to all Predix UI components
* Default Predix color values have been removed from all of the CSS variables provided in the system. Without a theme, components will appear with a mostly monochromatic "generic" theme.
* You should include `px-theme` or `px-dark-theme` in your application, or create and include your own theme, to style the Px components accordingly. See the documentation [here](#/develop/migrate/theme) for more information.
* `px-localize-behavior` has been deprecated. All of the localized components will ship with English translations by default, but applications should provide their own resources object as necessary in order to localize components for non-English languages.

# New Components
## px-accordion
* The `px-accordion` component provides expandable and collapsible subsection headers for a page. [API Documentation](#/elements/px-accordion)

## px-app-header
* The `px-app-header` component can be used as a wrapper for `px-branding-bar` and `px-app-nav`. It provides a container that stays fixed to the top of the screen. [API Documentation](#/elements/px-app-header)

## px-app-route
* The `px-app-route` component supports easy binding between various Predix UI components and a web application's URL. It helps keep UI state in sync with the URL, allowing users to bookmark or share views by copying their URL. [API Documentation](#/elements/px-app-route)

## px-branding-bar
* A component providing a header area to contain title, logo and branding content. [API Documentation](#/elements/px-branding-bar)

## px-breadcrumb
* Breadcrumb dropdown displays the navigational path of the user through a context browser. The breadcrumb links provide a way to see the path of navigation or contextual relationship between objects. It also provides a quick way to navigate backwards within a path or within a specific context.

## px-heatmap-grid
* The `px-heatmap-grid` is a highly visual and flexible interactive component for visualizing a data set based on a heat map scale of colors. [API Documentation](#/elements/px-heatmap-grid)

## px-icon-set
* Displays Predix icons. The icons were optimized for different sizes based on their category or intended usage. [API Documentation](#/elements/px-icon-set)

## px-key-value-pair
* The `px-key-value-pair` component allows you to prominently display information in a dashboard. [API Documentation](#/elements/px-key-value-pair)

## px-tree
* The `px-tree` component provides an expandable and selectable tree. The contents are controlled primarily through a structured object of branch and leaf nodes. [API Documentation](#/elements/tree/px-tree)


# Existing Components

## px-alert-label (v2)
* New boolean property `badge` has been added for enabling the alert/severity badges currently used in `px-alert-message` and `px-inbox` - the `type` property determines what color and shape will appear, whereas the `label` property can be repurposed for the (single-digit) numeric indicator
* The `type` value "info" was expanded to "information" in order to match the API of `px-alert-message`, however either value will work as expected.

## px-app-nav (v2)
* The `px-app-nav` API, design, and usage was completely overhauled for the new version, see the [documentation](#/components/px-app-nav) for a full guide.
* Clicking on an item in `px-app-nav` no longer automatically navigates to the item's URL by setting the `window.location`. Instead, listen to the event `selected-changed` for updates when an item is selected and sync the state to the URL if you choose (e.g. by setting `window.location`, using a framework router, or using the new `px-app-route` helper element).
* The `navItems` property has been renamed to `items`. The format of the navigation items object has also changed.
* In `navItems`, child items used to be added to a parent item with the `subitems` key. Now in `items`, child items are added to a parent item with the `children` key.
* In `navItems`, item paths used to be set with the `path` key. Now in `items`, item paths are set with the `id` key.
* In `navItems`, an `eventName` used to be passed so that it would be fired when the item was tapped. That option has been removed from `items`. Instead, watch `selected-changed` for updates when a new item is selected (when tapped or through data binding).
* All icon names used in `navItems` should be updated to use the new `px-icon-set` names. If you do not update to use the `px-icon-set` names, you will need to load the font awesome icons in your app. The font awesome icons will not be loaded with the `px-app-nav` component by default.
* The `navContracting` and `navExpanding` properties have been removed. See the `collapseOpened` property for an approximate replacement.
* The `pathPrefix` property has been removed as `px-app-nav` no longer navigates the page directly when an item is clicked. You can implement this yourself by listening to `selected-changed` and setting the URL.
* The `pathKey` property has been removed.
* The `markSelected` method has been removed. Use the `select()` method to select an item by reference.
* The nav is no longer configured to be vertical and toggle to open/close by default. There are now a variety of modes available (horizontal, vertical, collapsed) for different use cases. See the documentation for more information. To use the vertical mode, set the `vertical` property to true. The vertical mode is no longer meant to be used on mobile. The `collapsed` mode should be used on mobile instead.

## px-calendar-picker (v1)
* Updated the style for 'today' resulting in `--px-calendar-today-border` being added.
* The CSS variable `--px-calendar-labels--text-color` was updated to `--px-calendar-title-color`. The CSS variables `--px-calendar-background-color`, `--px-calendar-background-color--selected--hover`, and `--px-calendar-background-color--selected--pressed` have been removed due to design changes.

## px-card (v1)
* The `chevron` property has been removed, as it never really functioned as intended ([Forum Question](https://forum.predix.io/questions/21210/what-is-the-reason-for-the-chevron-button-on-the-p.html)). Instead, a content slot has been added so that anything included in a container of class "actions" will be displayed in the top right corner of the card in the header area. See the [demo page](#/modules/px-card) for an example implementation.
* The documentation of this repo has been greatly improved and decluttered. For information on the `px-deck`, `px-dashboard`, and `px-card` behavior components of this repo, use the dropdown at the top of the demo page.
* A new property called `fullBleed` has been added, which causes the content area of the card to stretch the full width of the card, removing the default horizontal padding. Useful for cards containing maps, images, and other content that requires more horizontal space.

## px-colors-design (v1.0.1)
* All of the sass variable names have changed to support the completely redesigned Predix UI color palette.

## px-context-browser (v2)
* The `px-context-browser` API, design, and usage were completely overhauled for the new version, see the [documentation](https://www.predix-ui.com/#/components/px-context-browser) for a full guide.
* The `<px-context-browser></px-context-browser>` tag no longer places a button on the page. Use the `px-context-browser` tag together with a `<px-context-browser-trigger></px-context-browser-trigger>` tag to show a button that opens the browser. See the documentation for more information on binding these two elements together.
* The `browserContext` property has been renamed to `items`. The structure of the context browser items has been completely overhauled.
* The `browserContext` property `name` has been replaced with `label`.
* The `browserContext` property `identifier` has been replaced with `id`.
* The `browserContext` property `isOpenable` has been removed.
* The initial context and direct context modes have been removed. Set the `selected` property instead to select an item after loading the data.
* The `disabled` property has been removed.
* The `disableInfiniteScroll` property has been removed.
* The `handlers` property has been removed. Listen to the event `px-app-asset-children-requested` to be notified when new children should be loaded. Listen to the event `selected-changed` to be notified when an item is selected (tapped or selected through data binding). See the documentation for more info. There is no event fired when an item is tapped but not selected as that interaction pattern has been removed.
* The `idField` and `labelField` properties have been removed. Use the `keys` property to set both instead.
* The `openedItemName` property has been removed. Listen to the event `selected-changed` to be notified when a new item is selected.
* The `resize` property has been removed.
* The `selectedItem` property has been renamed to `selected`. Its behaviors are also slightly different, see the documentation.
* The `showChevron` property has been renamed to `showArrow`.
* The `showColumnBrowser` property has been removed.
* The `showColumnTypeahead` property has been removed. Use the `showFilter` property to show a filter field at the top of the column.
* The `addParents` method has been removed. Instead, add items from the root of the graph using `addChildren`.
* The `toggleColumnBrowser` method has been removed. Toggle the `collapsed` property to show or hide the context browser.
* The events have changed completely. See the documentation for more details.

## px-data-table (v4)
* The "rows per page" dropdown has been updated to use `px-dropdown` for cross-browser consistency ([#115](https://github.com/predixdev/px-data-table/issues/115)).
* When a custom `pageSize` value is passed into the table, it will be displayed as the selected choice in the "rows per page" dropdown ([#118](https://github.com/predixdev/px-data-table/issues/118)).
* A new property for `pageSizeOptions` has been added, which allows developers to specify their own array of options for the "rows per page" dropdown ([#123](https://github.com/predixdev/px-data-table/issues/123)). Add the same option to both `pageSize` and `pageSizeOptions` to make it both the default choice as well as a persistent option.
* The `tableRows` property has been removed, as horizontal borders are now the default style for Predix UI tables. It has been replaced with a `tableCells` property, which can be used to create the previous default style, a table with both horizontal and vertical borders.

## px-datetime-field (v1)
* The `allowWrap` property has been added to allow the buttons, if showing, to wrap under the field.
* The CSS variables for the height `--px-datetime-field-height` and background color `--px-datetime-field-background-color` have been added. The validation design has been updated; therefore, `--px-datetime-border-color-validation--failed` has been removed.

## px-datetime-range-field (v1)
* The `allowWrap` property has been added to allow the second field and buttons, if showing, to wrap under each other. The `hideIcon` has been exposed to hide the calendar and clock icons if desired.
* The validation design has been updated; therefore, `--px-datetime-range-field-text-color-validation--failed` has been removed.

## px-datetime-range-panel (v1)
* The z-index value has been exposed in the `--px-range-panel-z-index` CSS variable
* Presets can now be functions. See API docs (https://www.predix-ui.com/#/elements/datetime/px-datetime-range-panel:property-presetRanges) for an example.

## px-datetime-range-panel (v1)
* The z-index value has been exposed in the `--px-range-panel-z-index` CSS variable
* The overlay has been removed; therefore, `--px-datetime-picker-overlay-color` has been removed. The `--px-datetime-picker-background-color--hover` and `--px-datetime-picker-background-color--pressed` have also been removed.

## px-dropdown (v4)
* The `px-dropdown-content` subcomponent no longer exists. Several properties have been moved to the main `px-dropdown` component.
* Most of the CSS variables for `px-dropdown` have gone away. Styling for the invoking element can still be achieved using the `buttonStyle` property and the CSS variables for buttons.
* The `boundTarget` property now expects a CSS selector string instead of a reference to the actual HTML element that will be used for the outer bounds of the dropdown.
* The `checkboxMode` property is now called `multi`.
* By default, the dropdown button will display the selected item or number of selected items ([#34](https://github.com/predixdev/px-dropdown/issues/34)). Use the `hideSelected` property to disable this behavior in use cases such as `px-data-table`, where the `displayValue` of "Show/Hide Columns" should always be displayed.
* The `displayValue` property is no longer overwritten when the user selects an item. In `multi` mode, the `displayValue` is appropriately restored when all selections are cleared ([#40](https://github.com/predixdev/px-dropdown/issues/40)).
* A new clear button has been added for quickly de-selecting all values and restoring the dropdown to its default state and `displayValue`. This also allows users to clear the dropdown when not in multi-select mode, which was not previously possible.
* When `multi` is false (i.e. single-select mode), use `selectBy` to determine whether a "key" or "val" will be passed to the `selected` property. When `multi` is true, use `selectBy` to determine whether an array of "key" or "val" items will be passed to the `selectedValues` property. In either single or multi mode, the `selectedItems` property will contain a reference to the actual `<div>` elements in the dropdown that have been selected.
* Set `sortMode` to "key" or "val" to sort the dropdown options. By default, they will be displayed in the order they are passed in to the `items` array. The `sortCheckedItems` and `sortDisabledItems` properties have been removed for simplicity.
* The `px-dropdown-value-changed` and `px-dropdown-checkbox-changed` events have been consolidated into a single `px-dropdown-selection-changed` event, which will fire in either single or multi-select mode.
* All of the orientation and sizing logic has been simplified by using Google's `iron-dropdown` instead of the custom code in previous versions of dropdown. The properties for `extendDropdown`, `extendDropdownBy`, `maxContentCharacterWidth`, and the use of `px-tooltip` have all been removed.
* Similar to `px-tables-design`, the styling for the exterior borders and interior borders have been separated to enable the new design. The CSS variables have been separated accordingly to distinguish between `--px-data-table-border-color` (exterior) and `--px-data-table-separator-color` (interior).
* Keyboard support has been added for accessibility.

## px-forms-design (v2)
* Many of the CSS variables for the form inputs have been removed, changed, or renamed based on the redesigned components. See [the API](#/css/visual/px-forms-design) for the full list of updated CSS variables.

## px-headings-design (v1)
* In addition to the six heading sizes previously available, new classes have been added to enable aspects of the Predix redesign. New heading styles include `heading--page` (large), `heading--section` (all caps), and `heading--subsection` (smaller, with a background). Additional styles have also been added for the label/value pairs often seen in Predix applications with the classes `label` and `value`.

## px-icon-set (v2)
* The `px-polymer-font-awesome` repository has been renamed to `px-icon-set`, and all of the Font Awesome icons have been replaced with the custom Predix UI icons created during the redesign. The API has also  changed (`<px-icon icon="">` is now used), and all of the new icons fall into 3 different namespaces (`pxs:icon`, `pxm:icon`, and `pxl:icon` as opposed to the previous `fa:fa-icon`) and new icon names. Both `px-icon-set.html` and `px-icon.html` should be imported in your application. See [the API](#/modules/px-icon-set) page for the full icon list and cheat sheet.

## px-inbox (v2)
* The `height` property has been removed in favor of the `--px-inbox-height` CSS variable, which defaults to 100vh. Also, a `--px-inbox-list-width` variable has been added, which defaults to 320px (previously the list was set to take up 1/3 of the total component.
* List items can now be passed without a severity, in which case an icon will not appear next to the item.
* A new boolean property called `disableAutoSelect` has been added which will prevent the inbox from automatically selecting the first item in the list ([#7](https://github.com/PredixDev/px-inbox/issues/7)). A check was also added so that when a `selectedItem` is passed into the component, it will not be overridden by this behavior.
* Both ascending and descending sort are now possible using either the `sortOrder` property or the arrow icon next to the sort dropdown ([#6](https://github.com/PredixDev/px-inbox/issues/6)).

## px-list-ui-design (v2)
* Similar to `px-tables-design`, the styling for the top/bottom borders and interior borders have been separated to enable the new design. The CSS variables have been separated accordingly to distinguish between `--px-list-ui-border-color` (top/bottom borders) and `--px-list-ui-separator-color` (interior borders).

## px-overlay (v1)
* The `type` property and the two corresponding CSS variables have been removed. Use the new `--px-overlay-color` CSS variable with an rgba value to adjust the color and opacity of the overlay.

## px-progress-bar (v1)
* The `striped` and `animated` properties have been removed as part of the redesign. An `infinite` property takes the place of both properties for distinguishing between a determinate/measurable progress bar that fills from left to right (when "false" or omitted) and an indeterminate/infinite progress bar (when "true") that continually animates when a discrete percentage can't be calculated.

## px-rangepicker (v2)
* The overlay has been removed; therefore, `--px-datetime-picker-overlay-color` has been removed.
* The `allowWrap property` has been added to allow the second field to wrap.

## px-tables-design (v2)
* The `table--rows` flag and class have been removed, as horizontal borders are now the default style for Predix UI tables. It has been replaced with a `table--cells` flag and class, which can be used to create the previous default style, a table with both horizontal and vertical borders.
* Styling for the exterior borders and interior borders have been separated to enable the new Predix design for tables, which features a darker top and bottom border and lighter interior borders. The CSS variables have been separated accordingly to distinguish between `--px-table-border-color` (top/bottom) and `--px-table-separator-color` (interior borders).

## px-tabs (v1)
* The `bare` and `noBottomBorder` properties have been removed. The bare style is now the default/only appearance for Predix UI tabs. Several of the related CSS variables have also been removed.

## px-tooltip (v1)
* The `tooltip-style` property has been removed. See the [theming documentation](#/develop/migrate/theme) for more information on using the light and dark theme, or use the provided CSS variables to override the style of the component.
