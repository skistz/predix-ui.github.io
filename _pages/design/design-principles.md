The Predix apps are built around our four design principles that are prioritized by the needs of industrial application users. When building Predix applications, use them as a tool to aid in to making design decisions.

## Purposeful
Design for clarity in purpose by utilizing context and clear calls to action that allow for fast orientation.

## Efficient
Be respectful of a user's time and recognize their workflow. Anticipate ways for people to work better and faster.

## Consistent
Rely on familiar visual styles and similar interactions for common patterns across the suite of Predix apps.

## Elegant
Utilize modern visual and interaction conventions. Recognize opportunities to create and own magic moments.
