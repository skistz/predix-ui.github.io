The Predix apps are built around our four design principles that are prioritized by the needs of industrial application users. When building Predix applications, use them as a tool to aid in to making design decisions.

Design for clarity in purpose by utilizing context and clear calls to action that allow for fast orientation.

### <px-icon icon="px-fea:dashboard"></px-icon>  Efficient
Be respectful of a user's time and recognize their workflow. Anticipate ways for people to work better and faster.

### <px-icon icon="px-obj:fleet"></px-icon>  Consistent
Rely on familiar visual styles and similar interactions for common patterns across the suite of Predix apps.

### <px-icon icon="px-obj:wind-turbine"></px-icon>  Elegant
